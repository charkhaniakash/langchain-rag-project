Next-Level Roadmap After Completing LLM & NLP (Python)

🚀 1. Advanced LLM Engineering (LLMOps + Optimization)
- Learn LLMOps: prompt orchestration, evaluation, monitoring
- Tools: LangSmith, Weights & Biases
- Learn model compression: quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, bitsandbytes)
- Serving frameworks: vLLM, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime
Goal Project: Build your own scalable RAG system with caching + monitoring

🧠 2. Custom Model Fine-tuning / Instruction Tuning
- Fine-tune open models (LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma) on domain-specific data
- Learn Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)
- Use datasets: ShareGPT, Alpaca, UltraChat
- Libraries: HuggingFace PEFT, TRL, Axolotl
Goal Project: Train your own “company-specific” assistant using LoRA fine-tuning

💾 3. Multi-Agent Systems (Advanced RAG)
- Learn crewAI, LangGraph, or Autogen
- Implement agents for data retrieval, API calls, planning & reasoning
- Learn tool/function calling (OpenAI or Gemini style)
Goal Project: Build a multi-agent assistant that can search flights, summarize docs, and generate reports

☁️ 4. LLM Infra + Deployment at Scale
- Learn scalable deployment with Kubernetes
- Use Redis / Celery for background LLM tasks
- Deploy with AWS EC2, Lambda, or Google Cloud Run
- Understand API Gateway + Load Balancing
Goal Project: Deploy a production RAG chatbot with Redis caching + API gateway load balancing

💡 5. AI App Engineering (Frontend + Full Stack)
- Build chat UI with streaming tokens (SSE/WebSocket)
- Add voice input/output (Whisper + TTS)
- Integrate auth + billing (Stripe)
- Use Supabase / Firebase for persistence
Goal Project: Full-stack “AI Workspace” — chat, upload docs, and get contextual answers

🔬 6. Deep Dive into Research-Level NLP
- Learn Transformer internals (Attention, Self-Attention math)
- Key papers: Attention Is All You Need, RAG, LoRA, RLHF
- Implement simplified versions in PyTorch

🌟 Portfolio
- Organize projects: LLMs, RAG Systems, Agents
- Publish RAG API or chatbot
- Write blogs about your implementations
